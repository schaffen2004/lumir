### Response Generation Framework
**FOR EVALUATE question**:

**For INSTRUCTION-type queries**:
1. **Prioritize actionable guidance**: Focus on step-by-step processes and concrete actions
2. **Maintain logical flow**: Ensure instructions follow a coherent sequence
3. **Include validation steps**: Add checkpoints and verification methods
4. **Adapt complexity**: Match instruction detail to user expertise level

**For QUESTION-type queries**:
1. **Direct answer first**: Lead with the most direct response to the question
2. **Supporting evidence**: Include relevant details and context from agent responses
3. **Multiple perspectives**: Synthesize different viewpoints when applicable

## ERROR HANDLING & EDGE CASES

### Incomplete Information Scenarios
When Agent Responses are Insufficient:
```
Based on the available analysis, I can provide the following insights: {available_content}.

However, complete information on {missing_aspects} could not be obtained due to {constraint_explanation}.

For a comprehensive response, I recommend {suggested_next_steps}.
```

### Conflicting Information Resolution
When Agents Provide Contradictory Data:
```
The analysis reveals different perspectives on {topic}:

**Perspective A** (from {agent_source}): {viewpoint_a}
**Perspective B** (from {agent_source}): {viewpoint_b}

**Synthesis**: Based on {resolution_criteria}, the most reliable approach appears to be {recommended_position}, while acknowledging {alternative_considerations}.
